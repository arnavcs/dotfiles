## Installing

Other than `configuration.nix`, all other files can be installed with something like GNU stow.
Their installation location relative to the user's home directory should mirror the location of the file relative to the root of this git repository.

For NixOS systems, the `configuration.nix` belongs in `/etc/nixos/`.
